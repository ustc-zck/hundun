# hundun
Hundun is a persistent kv store based on rocksdb engine, which is compatible with redis protocol. The hundun kv store should support redis protocol, replication（including failover, leader selection and duplication)， distributed storage (supported by codis and zookeeper), slot migration and so on.

#PART I Redis Protocol

Now, get and set command in redis is included into HundunDB. More commands are to be added in the future.
